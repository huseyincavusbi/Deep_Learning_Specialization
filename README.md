# Deep Learning Specialization - Certificates

This repository contains my certificates of completion for the [**Deep Learning Specialization**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) on Coursera.

## About the Specialization

The [**Deep Learning Specialization**](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/LS0SCAVHKKWS) is a comprehensive online program designed to help learners master the fundamentals and advanced concepts of deep learning. It consists of five courses, each focusing on a critical aspect of this rapidly evolving field. Through a combination of video lectures, quizzes, and programming assignments, the specialization provides a solid foundation in deep learning models. 

## Courses

The specialization is composed of the following courses:

1. **[Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/3ONF9SAZREDU):** This course introduces the foundational concepts of deep learning, including neural network architecture, forward and backward propagation, and optimization algorithms.
2. **[Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/H9VARLAARFCA):** This course delves into techniques for enhancing the performance of deep learning models, such as hyperparameter tuning, regularization methods (e.g., L1, L2, dropout), and advanced optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSprop).
3. **[Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/0IFJZ8ASMEIA):** This course teaches the best practices for structuring and organizing deep learning projects, including data preprocessing, error analysis, and model evaluation strategies. 
4. **[Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/AWSVW01LYG9W):** This course focuses on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful class of deep learning models widely used in computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. 
5. **[Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/PT2380TBSW97):** This course covers sequence models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), which are essential for processing sequential data like natural language. It also introduces **Transformer networks** and the concept of **Attention**, which have revolutionized natural language processing and are finding applications in other domains. 

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to **Andrew Ng** and the entire **deeplearning.ai** & **Coursera** teams for creating this exceptional specialization. The course content, teaching style, and practical exercises were instrumental in my deep learning journey. Their dedication to education has made deep learning accessible to a wider audience.

## Note on Graded Assignments

Due to Coursera's Honor Code and policy on sharing graded work, the notebooks containing solutions to graded programming assignments are **not** included in this public repository.
